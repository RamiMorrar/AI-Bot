The bot cannot interpret upper case letters or punctuation, there for capitalizing and exclamation marks are prone to error. 

For example

"whats the weather" is Ok
"What's The Weather?" is not.


Do keep in mind that this is not a universal bot that automatically open-up programs. You need to add them manually. The bot does not save
data either, so do not expect it to hold information again. 

As for me updating the bot, I might come back and visit it later. But for now this is a very early demo.
